> **1.** **Short** **Story** **of** **Business/Organization**
> **Challenge**
>
> Retail Nexus, an e-commerce company based in the UK, had to struggle a
> lot to maintain a competitive performance in the online retail market.
> Retail Nexus was grappling with several problems relating to
> underperforming products, fluctuations in seasonal sales, geographic
> imbalance in sales, and high product return rates. These issues posed
> a big barrier to achieving continued growth and customer satisfaction.
>
> **2.** **Problem** **Summary/Definition**
>
> The major problems that Retail Nexus had to face included: a. Poor
> contributions from underperforming products.
>
> b\. Missed opportunities in high-demand seasonal periods. c.
> Ineffective geographic and daily sales operations.
>
> d\. High product return rates that lead to losses. e. Poor marketing
> and resource allocation.

> that hampered their competitive advantage.

> **3.** **Solution/Recommendations/Decisions**
>
> Retail Nexus began to use data-driven approaches with advanced
> analytics:
>
> a\. Using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to segment customers,
> optimize marketing efforts, and improve customer engagement.
>
> b\. Targeting high-value customers with loyalty programs and exclusive
> offers.
>
> c\. Re-engage low-value customers with personalized discounts and
> recommendations.
>
> d\. Optimize inventory and marketing based on historical sales and
> predictive insight.

> clear improvements: revenue growth of 8% within three months,
> reduction in marketing costs by 20%, improvement in customer
> satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

<img src="./mbecu2d4.png"
style="width:7.16667in;height:4.5625in" />As seen in the figure, the r2
score closest to 1 was obtained using the random forest regression
model. When we apply the regression process, it is clearly seen that it
is the most appropriate model.

> <img src="./lr5vhyai.png"
> style="width:7.16667in;height:4.02083in" />When we calculate the mean
> square error for each model, the lowest error value occurs in the
> random forest regression model, as seen in the figure. As seen in the
> graph, the predictive value closest to the actual value was obtained
> using this model.

> **4.** **Follow-Up** **&** **Evaluation** **Plan**
>
> Retail Nexus will continue and enhance these results through the
> following:
>
> a\. Regular refreshes of predictive models and clustering strategies
> with newer data.
>
> b\. Continuously monitor the performance of loyalty programs and other
> marketing campaigns.
>
> c\. Assess the trends in seasonality to rework the inventory
> strategies.
>
> d\. Acquire and act on consumer feedback to maintain customer
> satisfaction and loyalty.
>
> e\. Ensure data analytics on-site and operational teams co-operate in
> strategy refinement for ever-changing market conditions.
