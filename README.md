- **a.** Using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to segment customers, optimize marketing efforts, and improve customer engagement.
- **b.** Targeting high-value customers with loyalty programs and exclusive offers.
- **c.** Re-engaging low-value customers with personalized discounts and recommendations.
- **d.** Optimizing inventory and marketing based on historical sales and predictive insight.

As shown in the figure, the **R² score closest to 1** was obtained using the **random forest regression model**. This indicates that the model is the most suitable for our analysis.

When we calculate the **mean square error (MSE)** for each model, the **lowest error value** is observed in the random forest regression model. This confirms that the predictive values are closest to the actual values using this model.
